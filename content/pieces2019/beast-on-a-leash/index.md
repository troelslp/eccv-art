Beast on a Leash is an art piece created by butterflies and AI. An AI system was
used to track the flight paths of butterflies in video footage. The system then
creates new shapes and movies from the tracking results. The most interesting
output is curated by the artist and realized as real artworks (prints or mixed
media). The project explores a holistic interpretation of creation and freedom
in which the boundaries between, man, animal and machine have faded.
