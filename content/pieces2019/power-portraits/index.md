For this piece, a series of photographs of board members of major tech companies
were passed through Googleâ€™s Vision API, and the resulting facial landmark
datasets were printed as a set of posters. The posters were printed on brightly
coloured backgrounds, to attract attention in the same way that advertising
imagery often does. The face landmarks are represented as small circles and the
outline boundary of the detected face is shown as a rectangle. Each face is
shown at a similar scale and while the faces are represented in an abstracted
way, the differences can be worked out by the viewer when the images are shown
in a series, allowing visual comparison between them. In this work, the actual
faces of the people who make decisions about the governance of companies that
develop invasive or compulsive technologies had one of these technologies turned
on their own images. I intended this to puncture the sense that board members of
tech companies are themselves invisible and inscrutable, appearing only through
their mediated image and through the products they are responsible for managing.
