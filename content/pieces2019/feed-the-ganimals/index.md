Feed the ganimals in their natural habitat with Satoshis (1 Satoshi = 0.00000001
Bitcoin, or ~ $0.000119 USD) to see more mystic creatures breed into a herd of
unique ganimals. Every transaction is taken for feeding the newborn inhabitants
of the wild ganimal conservatory until they’re ready to swim, garble, crawl,
skip or gallop back into the outside world. Every transaction paid to the
Ganimal Conservatory Bitcoin wallet will yield a transaction ID that is hashed
and stored as part of the generational script for the next ganimal, making every
creature unique from its predecessors.

We are exposing the creatures of the hyperdimensional GAN universe, the
Ganimals, where photographic evidence for phantasmagoric creatures can be
synthesized immediately and at scale. This emergent technology offers new
possibilities for folklore, storytelling and digital conservatories to explore
Earth's last frontier - the ocean. Only 5-15% of the oceans have been mapped and
over 60 species of underwater animals were discovered in 2018 by scientists. We
want to image what else is under the sea. To both augment the capability for new
mythical storytelling, we present a hashed translation ID schema that presents
each Ganimal as a unique entity on a blockchain. Each entity is uniquely
described by a cryptographic hash, which encodes its embedding in semantic
space.
