As sea levels rise and habitats are systematically destroyed, species are
undergoing extinction at an unprecedented rate. But artificial life is
flourishing. _Breed the Ganimals_ is a collaborative social experiment to
interact with new artificial species, and breed your own. Generated by the
imagination of a deep neural network, and fed by crowd ratings, these ganimals
offer us new possibilities for exploration and observation of intelligent
evolution. Explore the diversity of creatures generated by a deep neural
network, and help produce new generations of ganimals by providing feedback.
This data helps the algorithm adaptively learn to produce cute, creepy, and
realistic ganimals.
