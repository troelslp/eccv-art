This work is one of the #latentDoodles  series. Though purely generative, the idea behind
the series is to create marks evocative of human hand and folksy, but with hints
of generative computational origin through pattern repetition and grid.
Vis-Ã -vis abstract nature of generated images, i work carefully on image
captioning, to give them additional (verbal) dimension

The image was generated by SNGAN trained on my sketches and doodles, upscaled
with cycleGAN and then colorized by cycleGAN chaining to achieve the textural
effect reminiscent of hell
