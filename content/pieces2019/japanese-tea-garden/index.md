My initial experiments in computational photography were driven by my desire to
create photo-based depictions of the world that better convey the feeling of a
place and the way we really experience it: not just visually, but also
viscerally and cognitively. My grand format landscape images that result from
these experiments are inspired by the 19th century master paintings of the
Hudson River School and by the great romantic European landscape paintings that
preceded them. Like those works, some of which reached ten feet in width, I've
endeavored to create uncannily immersive and idyllic scenic experiences that
deliver both breadth and detail. Now, capitalizing on recent technological
developments in deep learning and artificial intelligence, along with the hard
work and ingenuity of my generous engineering colleagues, Joseph Smarr (Google)
and Chris Lamb (NVIDIA), I've been able to push my artwork in an intriguing new
direction. Thanks to custom enhancements made to Google's DeepDream software, it
has become possible for me to imbue my giant landscape images with a stunning
degree of unexpected form and content. My latest work submitted here further
investigates the possibilities of human-AI hybrid art by exploring multi-level
"dreaming" effects. These works begin with a detail of one of my panoramic
images to which multiple styles of neural network "hallucination" are applied at
multiple scales. Unlike my previous "full scene" Dreamscapes, which appear
completely photographic from a distance, these large works are clearly
hallucinatory upon first impression, yet still contain intricate details that
defy expectations.
