Blackberry Winter is a triptych of artificial human motion, telling the story of
movement as a continuous walk through a latent space of situations. The three
progressions unfold in asymmetry, exploring the possibilities of the human body
in a neverending choreography.

The three different sequences and their ongoing
neural relationship were developed using a custom machine learning solution to
weave spatial information into contemporary GAN technology.
