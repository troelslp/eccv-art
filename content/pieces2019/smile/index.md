_Smile_, is a mixed-media installation consisting of a screen situated in a black
box, mounted on the wall. The screen is black. However, when an interactor
smiles at the installation, drone-footage of the ruins of Gaza, digitally
slowed-down by the artist, fades in. If the interactor stops smiling, the videos
stops. It only plays when the interactor widely smiles at it.

The Gaza strip is a self-governing Palestinian territory on the eastern coast of the
 Mediterranean Sea, that borders Egypt on the southwest and Israel on the east
 and north. Gaza and the West Bank are claimed by the State of Palestine.

The 2014 50-day war between Israel and Hamas claimed the lives of more than 2,150
 Palestinians, wounded more than 10,000 and displaced an estimated 300,000
 people. On the Israeli side, at least 64 soldiers were killed and six civilians
 died. Since then, only one third of the 11000 homes destroyed have been
 rebuilt.

Western cultural relationship with war often frames it from a fascinated alien
perspectiveâ€“war as entertainment. Simultaneously engaging in processes that do
not alleviate the structural power inequalities that originate the conflict.

 The installation reflects on the construction of a spectacle from otherwise dramatic
news, as well as reflecting on the otherness and dehumanization of war.

 The piece also explores on the power asymmetries that technology crystallises where
spectators are forced to surrender to the imposed narratives. The piece aims to
provide with a reflection on the aesthetics of our relationship with it, while
simultaneously showcasing the advancements in computer vision and human-computer
interaction.
