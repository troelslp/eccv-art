“Walking through Shanshui” is an interactive installation dedicates to reproduce
audiences the experience of creating Shanshui painting. Shanshui refers to both
the natural landscape and the Ink Wash painting which describes nature in a
semi-abstract way. The contents in a typical Chinese Shanshui scroll is more a
collage of scenes in a journey rather than a depiction on-site. Back in their
days, those Chinese literates travel and immerse themselves in the great nature.
They walk around and then go back to their canvas, fuse their memories and
present the world their Shanshui. In this piece, participants are invited to
walk inside the defined interactive space. The system will start to track the
moving position when she or he steps in. When the participant walks out, the
position log will be sent to the generative system and generate a Shanshui
painting in real-time and present to audiences immediately. "Walking Through
Shanshui" is not only to describe the general interactive process but also refer
to the original idea of Shanshui painting. We walk, travel and present the
memory of the experience in the form of Chinese traditional art.

There multiple CV techniques involved in this piece, include human position
tracking, GAN and a custom data set. The process of the data set include
multiple computer vision methods like block detection, edge extraction .etc.

This piece was created for artist's solo exhibition "The Love Of Shanshui" at
Shanghai Duolun Museum of Modern Art (01/11/2019 - 02/25/2019.)  And it's also
part of his later solo exhibition "Chinese New Literati" and exhibited twice at
Shanghai local galleries.

This piece is an extension of artist's earlier work - ShanshuiDaDA, which has
been shown at different venues, also selected to NeurIPS 2018 Machine Learning
for Creativity and Design workshop and AI Art Gallery. The long version
technical paper for the generative model developped for this piece has been
accepted to ICDAR 2019.
