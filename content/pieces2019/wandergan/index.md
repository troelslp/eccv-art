An interactive search journey in the imagined visions of a neural network. Given
a photo, an artificial intelligence painter tries to recreate its likeness, and
takes us through a visual journey in its search for the perfect reproduction.
The spectator can intervene in the process, and focus on areas of her interest
in the intermediate imagery. The painter will then shift its efforts to recreate
the chosen impression. The emerging experience may resemble wandering within a
vision or a dream.
