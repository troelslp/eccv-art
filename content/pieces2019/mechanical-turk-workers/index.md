_Mechanical Turk Workstation_, 2019, is comprised of two monitors installed on an office desk furnished with typical office supplies and a few distinct accoutrements, such as a custom flag, photographs of workspaces, artificial plants, and a half-filled coffee mug. On one monitor, Mechanical Turk workers, an [invisible labor force](http://brettwallace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/INSIDETHEAUTOMATON_AMAZINGINDUSTRIES_BrettWallace.pdf) on [Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform](https://www.mturk.com/), answer questions about why they work on the platform and the ups and downs of the work itself. Many appreciate the flexibility to work from home, but they are also visibly frustrated about their lack of voice, hidden management decisions, and the low pay rates on the platform. A second monitor plays a screen recording of the work tasks as seen by a worker, such as identifying and tagging images an artificial intelligence program could not identify without assistance from a human being. Turkers were paid $2.00 for a 2-minute video testimonial.

Mechanical Turk Workers, is comprised of two monitors installed on a typical office desk among paperwork and office supplies. One monitor plays interview testimonials of workers who earn extra cash in their spare time by performing micro-work tasks at piece-work rates on Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk platform. A second monitor plays a video of a typical task, identifying and tagging images an artificial intelligence program could not identify without assistance from a human being.

Turkers were paid $2.00 for short video testimonials about what they like and do not like about Turking.
