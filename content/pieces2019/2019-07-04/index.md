Chris’ most recent work, ‘TensorDream’ saw him working alongside A.I. to create landscape art. He customised a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) which is a kind of A.I algorithm capable of self-learning. Over a three-day period, the DCGAN studied thousands of landscape paintings (curated by Chris) in order to achieve an understanding of their composition and palette. This resulted in the A.I. being able to synthesize and create new compositions in seconds. Chris then painted his favorite results in oil, thus transforming the imaginings of the A.I. into a language that human beings understand, a real oil painting.
