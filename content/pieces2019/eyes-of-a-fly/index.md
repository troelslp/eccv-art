The artist’s recent work focuses on the perceptual system’s ability to integrate
visual stimuli that in isolation seem to be abstract, into coherent, concrete
composites. The Eyes of a Fly imagines seeing through compound eyes that sense
visual images separately, organizing them into ensemble images via late-stage
processing. The improvising artist uses perceived high-level patterns to
organize tilings, triggering custom algorithmic transforms for tessellation, 2D
pixel migration and etching, and 3D pixel-to-column projection based on pixel
brightness. All transforms are reversible, and therefore information-preserving.
