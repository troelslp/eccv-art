We modified an open-source GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to enable
transfer learning between the multiple phases of training. Using training data
from NASA’s LandSat satellite imagery and a model set of portraits, we explored
facial features amidst a changing landscape. Today, climate change is causing
destructive sea-level rise felt by many Micronesians. This work explores
visceral imagery to accompany the dramatic change in topography over time as a
result of climate change.

The land masses inhabited by 0.001% of the population are being swallowed by the seas because of carbon emissions the other 99.99% of the population has been releasing into the atmosphere for the past 50 years.

The Marshallese make up a part of that 0.001% of the population. They are no longer talking about mitigating the effects of climate change. They are trying to figure out how to survive the catastrophic results of climate change. They do not have any more time. They have no choice but to build upwards. Poet and activist Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner collaborated with us to create these pieces of a changing landmass, consumed by rising waters.

Satellite data gives us a perspective of this violent change from above and portraits of indigenous peoples allow us to see who is directly affected.
