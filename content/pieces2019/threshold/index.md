Threshold is a camera app that uses Machine Learning to detect patterns we might not otherwise be aware of. The prototype version prevents the user from capturing images that are too similar to existing photos of famous landmarks.

By using constraints the user is encouraged (forced) to create a different type of memory associated with the experience. The goal of the project is to create awareness of the subconscious decisions that occurs right before the shutter button is pressed.
