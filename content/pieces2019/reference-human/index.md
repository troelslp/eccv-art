Reference Human traverses a collage of people from ImageNet. The collage assembles figures
from a carefully-curated selection of ImageNet classes in order to materialize
dynamic relationships beyond those captured in the ImageNet taxonomy. These
configurations — child and preacher, protester and scab, photographer and
utopian — suggest new narratives, plausible chains of cause-and-effect. The
individual images are stitched together using a GAN into a unified (if chaotic)
whole. In the completed work, the camera pans slowly over the synthesized
landscape, endlessly revealing new figures and new relationships.

Reference Human uses a facial analysis algorithm to compute the 3D orientation
of every face in the selected categories of ImageNet. Another algorithm searches
through these orientations to identify pairs of faces looking into complementary
directions—faces which can participate in a shared gaze when collaged together.
The artist uses this computer vision algorithm as a tool, selecting from many
candidates a few to include in final work.

By blurring the boundaries between items in the dataset (both visually using a
GAN, and conceptually by suggesting new categories), Reference Human attempts to
restore the messy richness of the world we live in. Reference Human celebrates
the ways in which our world stubbornly resists quantification and categorization
and, in doing so, challenges the hegemony of the dataset. The title Reference
Human refers to the people depicted in the dataset (and shown in the collage),
who become archetypes that machine learning models use to classify others. (The
tendency of researchers to haphazardly enroll the likenesses of unknown and
unknowing subjects in their datasets is dramatized in recent projects by
Phillipp Schmitt and Adam Harvey). The title also nods to Alex Krizhevsky, a
computer scientist who set the standard for human accuracy on ImageNet
classification by manually classifying images for 1,000 classes in ImageNet.
This sense of the title acknowledges the human labor used to construct the
dataset, and the way that the task of object recognition is woven into human
experience. Finally, the title Reference Human, identifies the artist as the
reference for a new set of meanings brought to the images through the act of
curation and collage.
